Juju Charm Layers Index
=======================

This repo is the index of layers available for building Juju Charms.

Each layer is represented by a small JSON file in either the [`layers`](layers)
or [`interfaces`](interfaces) directory, depending on the type of layer, and
each file should conform to the schema encoded in the [`schema.json`](schema.json)
file.  Specifically, it must contain at least the following fields:

* `id`: The name by which the layer will be referenced in `layer.yaml`, e.g., `basic`
* `name`: The human-friendly name of the layer
* `repo`: The URL of the git or bzr repo for the layer
* `summary`: A short description of the purpose of the layer

The name of the file must match the ID field, with a `.json` suffix.

To add or modify a layer in the index, just create a PR against this repo in
which you have added the appropriate JSON file and run the
[`update_readme.py`](update_readme.py) script to update the index below.

If you would like to build a charm using a fork of this repo (e.g., to test a
new layer before submitting a PR, if you have private layers or layers under
test and don't want to use [local layers][local], etc.), you just need to pass
in a URL where the repo contents are available via HTTP/S to `charm-build`.
For example, to build using a fork in your personal namespace in GitHub:

```
charm build --interface-service https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myuser/layer-index/mybranch/
```
